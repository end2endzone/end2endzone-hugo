# TODO

- [ ] Implement proper highlighting
  
  - [ ] Find how to properly use `lineNumbersInTable = false` in order to get line numbers as a separate field from the code, this allows copying and pasting the code.
  
  - [ ] [QUESTION: code fences not highlighted as expected · Issue #267 · pacollins/hugo-future-imperfect-slim · GitHub](https://github.com/pacollins/hugo-future-imperfect-slim/issues/267)
  
  - [ ] Look for overriding a template in _hugo-future-imperfect-slim_ theme so that it does not inline `hljs` classes (and the likes) to highlighted code.

- [ ] Robots.txt and sitemaps.xml

- [ ] Create shortcodes for properly displaying galleries ?
