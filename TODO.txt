- Publish new baseurl for "https://end2endzone.github.io/"
- Fix image browsing such as the following urls:
  - https://end2endzone.github.io/fleurs-de-la-cours/
  - https://end2endzone.github.io/canards-sauvages-a-val-david/
- Change H1 H2, etc casing to be "as written". Remove automatic capitalization of first letter.
- Increase pagination to 20 posts/page instead of only 3.
- Create a script instead of using `public` directory as a submodule. This workflow is too much complicated.
