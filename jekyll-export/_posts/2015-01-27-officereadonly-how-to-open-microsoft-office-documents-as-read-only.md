# OfficeReadOnly

OfficeReadOnly is a tool that allows a user to open any Office Documents as a Read-Only document directly from the File Explorer.

It's main features are:

- Integrates into Windows File Explorer or the with the "Send to" folder.
- Supports Documents, Workbooks, Presentations and Diagrams.
- Supports both Microsoft Office 2003 (\*.doc) and Microsoft Office 2010 file extensions (\*.doc, and \*.docx).
- Can be used from the command prompt.

Microsoft Office does not supports opening files as read-only when right-clicking a document from the File Explorer menu and it does not support opening file as read-only from the command prompt. OfficeReadOnly was created to solve this issue. The only way to open a document read-only is to first open the appropriate application for the document and then use the "***File***" menu and select "***Open***". Then, user has to browse to the actual file and change the opening mode from "***Open***" to "***Open Read-Only***" and finally click the file. That is a long process for a task that should be simpler. OfficeReadOnly makes it easy to open a document as read-only right from the File Explorer. Simply right-click a document and select "***Open with Office Read-Only***".OfficeReadOnly also helps developers by keeping the file intact! Since OfficeReadOnly allows a user to open a file **directly** in read-only, it prevents the application from doing unintentional modifications to the file: every time a user opens an Office Document, the application will modify the document (without your knowledge) to change some meta-data. The meta-data change will happens even if you do not press "***Save***". The only way to prevent this is to open the file as read-only.

**Usage:** OfficeRO \[inputfile\]
