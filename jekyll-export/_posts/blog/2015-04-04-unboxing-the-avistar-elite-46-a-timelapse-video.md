Hi. For those interested, here is the first sequence of images I captured with my Canon EOS SL1 in order to make a timelapse video of the unpacking of the aircraft RC Avistar Elite .46. At the time, I didn't know the basic principles that were required to capture good pictures for a timelapse video. So I proceeded with the exact opposite of what was required: Auto Focus, auto exposure adjustment, automatic white balance, use of the flash and capture with low batteries. In short, I was a beginner. I have since gained experience and I wrote a guide that describes timelapse good practices and the steps to achieve a good timelapse video: [How to make a time-lapse video with free tools and a DSLR camera](/how-to-make-a-time-lapse-video-with-free-tools-and-a-dslr-camera/ "How to make a time-lapse video with free tools and a DSLR camera"). I decided to share the video anyway. I hope you appreciate... Antoine Captured June 13th, 2014 between 3:49 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. with 556 photos and 15 second interval between each picture displayed at 10 frames per second.
