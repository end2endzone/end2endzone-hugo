  I always liked to build and assemble things together. Doing this using nothing but my own hands. Unfortunately my hands never had the same point of view and I&#8217;ve never really been successful with manual tasks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  One day, my father bought myself an electronic lab kit which I loved playing with (<a title="Radio Shack 160 in 1" href="https://www.google.com/?q=160+In+One+Electronic+Project+Kit+1982+RADIO+SHACK#q=160+In+One+Electronic+Project+Kit+1982+RADIO+SHACK" target="_blank">this one!</a>). It felt amazing to connect simple components together using only wires and end up with something interactive! However, I soon lost interest but can&#8217;t really remember why.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Then I started reading a book about using how to program a computer. Quickly jumping to the end of the book, I understood that I could make awesome things like my own game!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This is why I felt in love with computer science. It was easy for me to create from nothing. Like many I started coding really simple stuff (read pong game or snakes!) in <a title="Basic Programming Language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC" target="_blank">Basic </a>when you had to assign numbers to each line of code. Since then the technology has evolved and so did I.

  I first connected with software development in college. Thing were easy in college and time went pretty fast. I graduated from <a href="http://cstj.qc.ca/">Cégep de St-Jérôme</a> in 2002.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Once done, I started university. Things were really different and it finally felt like a challenge! I graduated from <a title="My university" href="http://www.etsmtl.ca/" target="_blank">ÉTS (École de technologie supérieure)</a> university in 2006 and started working for a small company in Montreal. I was developing a management software in a very specific domain and I felt I was not at my place. I was missing the creative and dynamic aspect of the job. I started looking for a new job and found a perfect match.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I currently work for a world leader company in modeling, simulation and training. Most of my work is in C++ but from time to time, I have to use C# and Java. Since 2008, I managed to develop quite a good set of skills (mostly in software development but also in how software interact with the outside world/hardware).<br /> (Note to self, add a list of technologies I know)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I love the DIY way. If I have to buy something, I usually ask myself if I could make it first. Over time, I have been perfecting my skills in electronics and even wood working.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In my free time you can usually find me hanging out with my girlfriend, playing with my kid Louis, in front of a big screen watching a movie or working on one of many projects like <a title="Hobbies" href="http://www.end2endzone.com/hobbies/" target="_blank">theses</a>.
