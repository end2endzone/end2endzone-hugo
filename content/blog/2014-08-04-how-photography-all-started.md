Hi everyone. This is my first post regarding photography. I recently started this hobby but I had an interest in photography since a long time but never pursued this hobby because I always tough that good photography skills were not achievable or simply because you need a lot of gears that are expensive. Unfortunately, I changed my mind and rediscovered photography.

  Misconceptions

I always had high expectations about what a good camera should do and one of them was quick shooting in continuous mode (read 10-15fps). That feature was handy when you shoot moving objects or when you go to a water park because it allows you to freeze the action. (I tough high fps in continuous mode means a higher shutter speed)

I have spent hundreds of dollars on useless cameras that did not always shoot high quality photos but was shooting pretty quick! Man I was wrong! I started to try to understand why I didn't get the results I was expecting and started leaning about the technical aspect of photography.

# Time for a change

I understood that I needed a professional camera and that I had to move away from the "automatic mode" to the manual modes available with a DSLR camera.  I had to make some savings and finally bough a Canon EOS Rebel SL1.

Sooner I started to like the artistic aspect of photography and get curious about the technical aspect of every picture I came across.

# My gears

Here are the gears I currently own and use:  
* Canon EOS Rebel SL1  
* Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 STM IS  
* Manfrotto  190XPROB Tripod with 3D Head 804RC2  
* Macro extension tubes: 13mm, 21mm, 31mm  
* Many filters: ND2, ND4, ND8, UV, CPL, and FDL  
* Canon EOS AC Adaptor with DC Coupler DR-E15  
* A no-name Canon TC-80N3 intervalometer

Feel free to look at what I managed to shoot and don't hesitate to give positive comments.
