This is an Excel worksheet I created based on the calculations I found for calculating most R/C Transmitter mixes. It is designed to help you identify the effective range of a mix (finding the low, medium and high values).

See my post on [Demystifying RC Transmitter Mixing](/demystifying-rc-transmitter-mixing/) for more details.

  Please note the following calculator is valid on Spektrum Transmitters. I did not verified it's validity or accuracy on other transmitters.
