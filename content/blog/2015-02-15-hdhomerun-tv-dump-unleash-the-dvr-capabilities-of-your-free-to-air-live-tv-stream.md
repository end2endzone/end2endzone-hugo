# HDHomeRun TV Dump

_HdHomeRun TV Dump_&nbsp;is a [GUI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)&nbsp;that installs over the native [HDHomeRun application](http://www.silicondust.com/support/downloads/) and allows owners to quickly take control over the free to air live TV stream. Implementing DVR capabilities on your computer becomes a easy as 1-2-3.

It is designed to make interaction with the device easy by automating as much as possible any task a user would like to execute.

It's main features are:

  * Quicker & easier to understand and install than other DVR solutions like [MythTV](https://www.mythtv.org/) and [Windows Media Center](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows/products/windows-media-center).
  * Auto-detection of existing HDHomeRun devices on the network.
  * Auto-detection of busy tuners.
  * Automatic selection of an available tuner for watching or recording a live TV stream.
  * Manual recording support.
  * Scheduled recording support (enables DVR capabilities with the HDHomeRun)
  * Watch live TV streams.

_HDHomeRun TV Dump_ should also work with devices that supports the  MPEG4/H.264 video codec but this functionality is still untested.
