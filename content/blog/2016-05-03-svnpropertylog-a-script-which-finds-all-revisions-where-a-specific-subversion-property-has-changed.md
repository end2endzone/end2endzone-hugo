# Purpose

The subversion application does not offer native support for identifying changes to subversion properties as easily as changes to files.

The purpose of this script is to allows a subversion user to find all revisions where a change to a specific property occurred. In other words, it's a "_show log for subversion properties_".
Skip to the [download section](#Download) for quick download.

# Usage

The script has 5 command line arguments which are:

* Oldest revision number
* Newest revision number
* File or folder URL
* Property name
* Show property values? ( Must be  or _**1 **_)

## Execution (command line)

The script is written in [VBScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript).  Use the following to execute the script from a batch file (*.bat) :


```batch
@echo off
cscript //nologo "%~dp0svnpropertylog.vbs" 9 13 "http://localhost/svn/svnpropertylog/tests/folder" "svn:externals" 1
pause
```


## UI

[![svnpropertylog - Select Subversion Property](/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/svnpropertylog-property-sample.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/svnpropertylog-property-sample.png)

svnpropertylog - Select Subversion Property

A GUI application is also available. From a [file explorer window](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cb/Windows_Explorer_Windows_7.png?download), double-click on **_svnpropertylogGui_** and follow on-screen instructions: the UI will prompt the user for each command line argument and then launch the script.

## Output

On execution, the following output is produced by the script:


```
