# Introduction

Here is another arduino library that I have written.

As a desktop developer, I am not used to have memory (or even CPU) requirements as most developers will not look at memory consumption as an arduino developer would. Memory & CPU is cheap. If your application is struggling to run on today's computer, it will run smoothly in 1-2 years.

As most arduino developers have faced, the amount of memory available on embedded devices is pretty limited. Having a way to save bits or our precious memory is interesting.

BitReader is an arduino library that allows one to read or write data as chunks of bits.
Skip to the [download section](#Download) for quick download.

# Purpose

This BitReader library allows one to read data which is not necessarily aligned on 8, 16 or 32 bits structures.

  Note that since you are encoding data in binary format (bits), the trade-off is that more code is required to process/decode the data and there is a small performance delay required for decoding the data
{{< /pleasenote >}}


The library is useful for storing or decoding data in binary format using the minimum amount of bits. For examples...

* [Shorter text strings](#Making_text_strings_shorter)
* [Shorter structures](#Shorter_structuresdefinition)
* [Shorter data arrays](#Make_data_arrays_much_shorter)

# Library features

Possible use are:

* Reduces size of data (strings, structures, arrays) in memory to the minimum amount of bits required.
* Help reading/updating bit-field structures.
* Handles bit [serialization ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization)data to/from buffers.

# Usage

Create an instance of _BitReader_, _BitWriter_ or _BitAddress_ depending on the following optimization switches:

* USE_BITADDRESS_SETTER_GETTER
* USE_SINGLEBIT_MACROS
* USE_BITADDRESS_READ_WRITE

Then assign a reading or writing buffer using the _setBuffer()_ method.

Then call the _write()_ method for writing bits to the assigned buffer or call the _read()_ method for reading bits from the assigned buffer. Each method allows one to specify the amount of bits to read or write.

## Making text strings shorter

Storing words composed of only lower case letters, spaces and dots requires only 5 bits per characters instead of 8 bits (which saves 3 bits per character). The phase "_hello my name is antoine. i wrote the bitreader library._" takes 56 bytes as an array of char but uses 35 bytes as 5 bits chunks.

Allow 6 bits per characters and you can also include capital letters and numbers: "_Hello my name is Antoine. I wrote the BitReader library when I was 34 years old._" takes 80 bytes as an array of char but only requires 60 bytes as 6 bits chunks.

## Shorter structures definition

The library is particularly useful for dealing with [bit-field structures](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/bit_field). Consider the following:


```cpp
struct Person {
  char name[10];
  char birthDay;
  char birthMonth;
  short birthYear;
  bool maried;
  char children;
};
```


The _Person_ structure requires 16 bytes in memory (10+1+1+2+1+1) or 128 bits. However, using bit-field structure, the _Person_ structure can be defined as the following:


```cpp
struct Person2 {
 uint8_t name[10]; //keep 8 bits per letters for compatibility.
 union
 {
   struct //aligned on 8 bits
   {
     uint8_t birthDay : 5; //from 1 to 31
     uint8_t children : 3; //from 0 to 7. 
     uint8_t birthMonth : 4; //from 1 to 12
     uint8_t maried : 1; //true or false
     //uint8_t : 3; //birthYear (low)
     //uint8_t : 8; //birthYear (high)
   };
   struct //aligned on 32 bits
   {
     uint32_t padding1 :13; //padding for birthDay, children, birthMonth, maried
     uint32_t birthYear :12; //allows years from 0 to 4095.
     //uint16_t : 4; //unused
   };
 };
};
```


The _Person2_ structure contains the same information as the _Person_ structure but instead of using 128 bits in memory it only requires 105 bits (80+5+3+4+1+12).

A _Person_ could also be defined with masks:


```cpp
struct Person3 {
  uint8_t name[10];
  uint32_t buffer;
};
static const uint32_t MASK_BIRTHDAY = (1&lt;&lt;4 | 1&lt;&lt;3 | 1&lt;&lt;2 | 1&lt;&lt;1 | 1&lt;&lt;0);
static const uint32_t MASK_CHILDREN = (1&lt;&lt;7 | 1&lt;&lt;6 | 1&lt;&lt;5);
static const uint32_t MASK_BIRTHMONTH = (1&lt;&lt;11 | 1&lt;&lt;10 | 1&lt;&lt;9 | 1&lt;&lt;8);
static const uint32_t MASK_MARIED = (1&lt;&lt;12);
static const uint32_t MASK_BIRTHYEAR =  (1&lt;&lt;24 | 1&lt;&lt;23 | 1&lt;&lt;22 | 1&lt;&lt;21 | 1&lt;&lt;20 | 1&lt;&lt;19 | 1&lt;&lt;18 | 1&lt;&lt;17 | 1&lt;&lt;16 | 1&lt;&lt;15 | 1&lt;&lt;14 | 1&lt;&lt;13);
static const uint32_t MASK_PADDING = (1&lt;&lt;31 | 1&lt;&lt;30 | 1&lt;&lt;29 | 1&lt;&lt;28 | 1&lt;&lt;27 | 1&lt;&lt;26 | 1&lt;&lt;25);
```


In the last 2 scenarios (_Person2_ and _Person3_), the BitReader library allows one to decode a _Person_ structure from a binary buffer.

## Make data arrays much shorter

Consider an algorithm that plays a [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). Morse code defines 3 symbols that can be played: dots, dashes and pauses.

For example, the following string "_Hello my name is Antoine. I wrote the BitReader library when I was 34 years old._" (56 bytes) translate into Morse code as


```
.... . .-.. .-.. --- / -- -.-- / -. .- -- . / .. ... / .- -. 
- --- .. -. . .-.-.- / .. / .-- .-. --- - . / - .... . / -... 
.. - .-. . .- -.. . .-. / .-.. .. -... .-. .- .-. -.-- / .-- 
.... . -. / .. / .-- .- ... / ...-- ....- / -.-- . .- .-. 
... / --- .-.. -.. .-.-.-
```


according to [this translator](http://morsecode.scphillips.com/translator.html). The whole code takes 267 bytes in memory. However, using 2 bits per code, the whole string can be encoded in a char buffer with only 534 bits (~67 bytes).

The same concept applies to all numeric array.
